# Privacy Policy for Alembic

**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026

At Alembic ("we," "our," or "us"), we recognize that your personal notes, documents, and voice recordings act as your "Second Brain." We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have full control over your data.

This Privacy Policy explains how Alembic collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you directly create or import into the App:

- **Content**: This includes text notes, photos, documents, and voice recordings you capture.
- **Account Information**: If you create an account, we store your email address and profile preferences (e.g., profession role).
- **Structured Data**: Data extracted by our AI from your content (e.g., transcripts, identified tasks, structured tables).

### B. Permissions We Request

To provide our core features, we require access to the following device capabilities:

- **Camera**: To capture images of documents, whiteboards, or physical objects for Visual AI analysis.
- **Microphone**: To record high-fidelity voice notes and meetings for transcription and summarization.
- **Photo Library / Storage**: To allow you to import existing images or audio files into the App.

## 2. How We Use Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Alembic utilizes advanced AI technologies (e.g., Google Gemini, Deepgram) to process your data.

- **Data Processing**: When you use features like "Visual Scan" or "Transcribe," the relevant media file is temporarily sent to our secure cloud processors.
- **No Training on User Data**: We do not use your personal notes, audio, or images to train our public AI models. Your data remains yours.
- **Transient Processing**: For AI analysis, data is processed in memory and is not permanently stored on AI provider servers as training data.

## 3. Data Storage and Sync

- **Local First**: Alembic is designed with a "Local First" architecture. Your data is stored locally on your device using an encrypted database (Realm).
- **Cloud Sync**: If enabled, encrypted synchronization allows you to access your notes across devices.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We only share information in the following limited circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: We use trusted third-party providers (Google Cloud, Deepgram) strictly for the purpose of executing AI tasks (transcription, image recognition).
- **Legal Compliance**: We may disclose information if required by law or legal process.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access & Export**: You can access and view all your notes within the App.
- **Deletion**: You can delete specific notes or request full account deletion. Deleting a note permanently removes it from our database.
- **Permissions**: You can revoke Camera or Microphone access at any time through your device settings, though this will disable related AI capture features.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Alembic is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by updating the date at the top of this policy.
