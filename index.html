Privacy Policy
Effective Date: December 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how 徐天长 (“we”, “us”) handles information when you use LittleHero (the “App”).

1. Summary
The App provides audio recording features. The App records audio only when you actively start a recording. Recordings are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.

2. Permissions We Request
Microphone / Audio Recording (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO)
We request the microphone permission only to enable the App’s recording/voice-related features. If you do not use these features, the App will not record audio.

3. Information We Collect
Audio recordings (user-generated content): When you choose to record, the App captures audio through your device microphone and saves the recording as an audio file on your device.

Personal information: We do not collect personal identifiers (such as name, email, phone number), location data, contacts, or other sensitive personal data.

4. How We Use Information
We use audio recordings only to provide in-app functionality such as:

Creating and saving recordings.

Playback and management of your recordings within the App.

5. Data Sharing
We do not share your audio recordings with any third parties.
We do not sell or rent your data.

6. Data Storage and Security
Local storage: Recordings are stored on your device’s local storage.

No server upload: We do not upload recordings to any server operated by us.

Security: Because recordings remain on your device, protection depends on your device security settings (e.g., screen lock, OS security updates).

7. Data Retention and Deletion
Recordings remain on your device until you delete them using the App’s delete functions or by removing the App / clearing its storage. You can delete recordings at any time.

8. Children’s Privacy
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The App records audio only when the user initiates a recording.

9. Your Choices and Controls
You can deny or revoke the microphone permission at any time in your device system settings.

If microphone permission is disabled, recording features will not work, but other parts of the App can still be used (if applicable).

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
